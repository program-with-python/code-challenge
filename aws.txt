To deploy this project to the cloud using aws, we can use following services 
and tools of aws.

First we can use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy Django application that powers the API.
This is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that makes it easy to deploy 
 and manage applications in the cloud.

 Next we can use Amazon RDS for database setup. As locally database use is postgres. 
 This service is easy to setup, operate and scale a relational database.

 AWS Lambda can be used to call the management commands and even we can schedule 
 using AWS CloudWatch Events.

 we can use AWS S3 to store our text files and the output text file can also be 
 stored in Amazon S3 Bucket.

 By using these AWS services and tools, we can easily deploy and manage our API,
  database, and data ingestion code in the cloud, 
 while also ensuring scalability, reliability, and security.
